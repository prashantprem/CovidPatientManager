# CovidPatientManager
CovidPatientManager is an android APP which helps in managing patients in a hospital.
In this project I have used express.js framework of Nodejs and mangoose to create REST API. For database I have used mongoDb and have deployed API on heroku.
All the frontend has been created inside Android Studio using XML. For backend of this app I have used JAVA.

# Tech used in this project
1) MongoDb
2) Heroku CLI
3) Node.js, express.js and mongoose
4) Android Studio
5) PostMan (To verify RESTful APIs)

This Project is already connected to MongoDb cloud storage and REST API is deployed on Heroku. UI is very simple with buttons for every action.
